Live Programming Language Design with Spoofax

Spoofax Language Workbench
- a work in progress
- sandbox for exploring abstractions for language engineering => meta-DSLs

Spoofax Meta-DSLs:
- SDF3: syntax definition <=============== today
- NaBL2: type systems <=================== today
- Stratego: program transformation
- DynSem: dynamic semantics
- SPT: testing <========================== today

Now go to demo.txt














Some work in progress

Language and tools:
- Layout-sensitive SDF3
- Statix: more expressive type systems
- FlowSpec: data flow analysis
- DynSem: dynamic semantics & interpreter generation
- PIE: flexible incremental workflows

Concepts:
- Scopes and frames: language independent represent of binding and memory
- Truly live language design
